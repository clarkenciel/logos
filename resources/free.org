Our environment has structure. Our bodies have structure.
Knowledge about the world and about ourselves comes about
through these structures interacting; the changes that each
induces in the other.

What I mean is this: The only way I can understand the world
is through my body. Likewise, the only way I can understand
my body is through using it in the world. Maurice Merleau-Ponty
described this as "the body outrunning itself toward the world."
